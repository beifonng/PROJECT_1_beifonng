<h1>A simple heading goes here</h1>
<p>all speakers have a degree of nervousness. 
a professional speaker with experience
has a heightened level of excitement before a presentation.
if nervousness is obvious, 
listeners can be distracted and miss the point
why is the first skill needed in performing a speech poise?
“easy, self-possessed assurance of manner… pleasantly tranquil”
The key to performing a speech is to appear calm and assured 
even when we may not feel remotely close to it.

The breakthrough for students here, 
initially,
was that poise is a skill — 
it's a thing
you can learn, practice, and improve.
