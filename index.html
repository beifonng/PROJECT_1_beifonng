<h1>Public Speaking</h1>
<p>all speakers have a degree of nervousness. 
<p>a professional speaker with experience
<p>has a heightened level of excitement before a presentation.
<p></p>if nervousness is obvious, 
<p></p>listeners can be distracted and miss the point
<p></p>why is the first skill needed in performing a speech poise?
<p></p>“easy, self-possessed assurance of manner… pleasantly tranquil”
<p></p>The key to performing a speech is to appear calm and assured 
<p></p>even when we may not feel remotely close to it.

<p></p>The breakthrough for students here, 
<p></p>initially,
<p></p>was that poise is a skill — 
<p></p>it's a thing
<p></p>you can learn, practice, and improve.
